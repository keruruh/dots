# dots

These are my personal dotfiles. Feel free to clone them and use whatever you want, but
don’t expect everything to work out of the box on your system.

I’m not aiming for this to be a polished, universal setup, so PRs and issues will be
ignored. This repo is just my own config. If you’re looking for something more
plug-and-play, you might enjoy [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/).
